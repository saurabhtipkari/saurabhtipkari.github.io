<h1>JVM</h1>
<p>
Parent class of JVM is known as class loader subsystem 
Jvm is not physically available 
During class, loading JVM work in three-phase
</p>
<h1>
1)Loading Phase:-
     <ul>
<li>a)Application class loader</li>
<li>b)Extention class loader</li>
<li>c)Bootstrap class loder</li> 
</ul>

2)Linking phase:-

3) Initialization phase:-

</h1> 
<h1>a) Application class Loader:-</h1>
<p>
it’s a chile class of extension class loader 
It takes a class to execute by mention “Environment Variable”
Or Manual path (set path).
</p>
<h1>b) Extension class Loader</h1> 
<p>
It is a child class of application class loader.
It verifies prototype for extension of execution application
It sends all the information for its parent class
</p>

<h1>c) BootStrap Class Loader</h1>
<p>
It is a parent class of extension class loader 
Bootstrap class loader provides Environment for application by using rt.jar file 
</p>

<h1>Phase 2 

Linking
</h1> 
<p>After loading a class linking process will be executed /stored during linking process unchecked exception will verify by JVM
</p>
<h1>Initialization phase</h1>
<p>
If an unchecked exception does not occur by JVM initiation will be started.
Object class is responsible for instanciation.
Once the initialization process memory/resources will be occupied 
</p>
</h1>a)class area:-</h1> 
<p>class area memory used to store the structure of the class.
non-static elements will be considered in class area memory.
</p>
<h1>b)Heap memory</h1>
</p> 
It is used to store object,non-static variable and methods.
It contains a metaspace special memory area to store static variable and methods.
</p>
<h1>c)Stack area </h1><p>
Stack memory is faster than heap memory.
It used to store local variable.</p> 
<h1>d)pc register</h1>
<p>it contains instruction and specification for memory management 
</p>
<h1>
JNI (Java Native Interface)
</h1>
<p>JNI gives an environment for external application.</p>
