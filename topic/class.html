<h1> Class:-In JAVA are used to the information.
</h1> 
 syntax:-  
          class class name
          {
           proparty;
           method;
           constructor;
          {
           block;       
          }
           static
          {
           block
          } 

-In JAVA text are 3 types of block which will execute automatically during 
 object creation.

<h1>a)Constructor:- it is special method some name of class.
</h1>
-constructorare use to initiat default value to the non-static veriable,
 we can set user define value bypassing promoter into a constrctor.

-Object class create empty constroctor into do not decleared by own. 
An entity that has state and behavior is known as an object e.g., chair, bike, marker, pen, table, car, etc. It can be physical or logical (tangible and intangible). The example of an intangible object is the banking system.

An object has three characteristics:

State: represents the data (value) of an object.
Behavior: represents the behavior (functionality) of an object such as deposit, withdraw, etc.
Identity: An object identity is typically implemented via a unique ID. The value of the ID is not visible to the external user. However, it is used internally by the JVM to identify each object uniquely.

<p>

<h1>b)Blocks:-(instance blocks)
</h1>
-Instance block are initilizer default values non-static veriable.

-It execute during objectcreation before constroter.

-We can decler only one instanceblock ina class.

<h1>C) Static Block:-
</h1>
-syntax:-
		static
		{
		}
static block used to initilize static variable.
static block execute during object creation before the construtor and instance blcok as well.
static block will execute only one time of class loading.
