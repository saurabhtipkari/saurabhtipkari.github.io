o	Unary Operator,
o	Arithmetic Operator,
o	Shift Operator,
o	Relational Operator,
o	Bitwise Operator,
o	Logical Operator,
o	Ternary Operator and
o	Assignment Operator.
</p>
<h1>Unary Operator</h1>
<p>
The Java unary operators require only one operand. Unary operators are used to perform various operations i.e.:
o	incrementing/decrementing a value by one
o	negating an expression
o	inverting the value of a boolean

Java arithmatic operators are used to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. They act as basic mathematical operations.
</p>
<h1>Java Left Shift Operator</h>
<p>
The Java left shift operator << is used to shift all of the bits in a value to the left side of a specified number of times.
	Java Right Shift Operator
The Java right shift operator >> is used to move left operands value to right by the number of bits specified by the right operand.
</p>
<h1>Java Ternary Operator</h1>
<p>
Java Ternary operator is used as one liner replacement for if-then-else statement and used a lot in Java programming. it is the only conditional operator which takes three operands.
</p>
